# CyVix

CyVix is a civic decision intelligence platform for the Google Cloud hackathon brief. It turns fragmented city signals into an explainable decision packet that helps public teams detect issues early, understand why they matter, and trigger the next action.

## 1. How We Approached The Problem Statement

We translated the broad problem statement into a focused product: a civic operations layer that can ingest structured and unstructured data, score risk, retrieve similar incidents, explain outcomes in natural language, and trigger follow-up workflows.

The solution maps directly to the Google Cloud ecosystem:

- `BigQuery` stores the city baseline and scenario history.
- `Vertex AI` performs risk scoring and prediction.
- `Gemini` turns outputs into plain-language explanations.
- `AlloyDB` stores and retrieves similar incidents and playbooks.
- `Cloud Run` serves the app shell and decision APIs.
- `Cloud Functions` handles automated follow-up actions.
- `Agent Development Kit (ADK)` orchestrates the observe -> reason -> retrieve -> explain -> act loop.
- `Looker` represents the leadership and operations dashboard layer.
- `Cloud Storage` and `Dataflow` are used in the data-ingest story.

The current build is fully demoable with local mock data and deterministic decision logic. It does not require live Google keys to run locally, but the code and documentation are structured so those services can be swapped in cleanly.

## 2. Real-World Problem And Practical Impact

Modern communities generate data from transit, utilities, weather, wellness signals, citizen feedback, and service logs. The hard part is not collecting data. The hard part is turning it into a decision that a city team can trust quickly.

CyVix helps with:

- Faster detection of service failures and neighborhood risk.
- Better prioritization for city operations teams.
- Clearer resident communication through explainable summaries.
- Better response coordination across departments.
- A single view for individual, organizational, and civic decision-making.

Example use cases:

- Transit delay escalation
- Water pressure drift
- Heat resilience and wellness risk
- Citizen service triage
- Emergency preparedness and recovery

## 3. Core Architecture And Workflow

CyVix follows a decision-intelligence pipeline rather than a static dashboard:

1. Ingest multi-source city data.
2. Normalize and baseline the signals.
3. Score anomaly and likely impact.
4. Retrieve similar incidents and playbooks.
5. Generate a civic explanation.
6. Propose the next best action.
7. Trigger automation and publish the decision trace.

### Decision Engine In The Repo

The current repo uses a local, deterministic decision engine so the demo works without external credentials:

- `lib/analytics.js` scores the scenario and builds the explanation.
- `lib/workflows.js` converts analysis into a recommendation packet.
- `lib/adk.js` builds the agent lifecycle trace.
- `lib/decision-engine.js` fuses the above into one decision object.
- `app/api/*` exposes the ingest, analyze, recommend, agent, and decision routes.

This gives the app a real backend shape now, while keeping it ready for a live Google Cloud swap later.

## 4. Opportunity And USP

CyVix is different from a generic civic dashboard because it does not stop at visualization.

USP:

- It produces a decision packet, not just charts.
- It shows the evidence trail, confidence, and counterfactual.
- It combines structured data, text signals, and historical memory.
- It makes the ADK lifecycle visible.
- It can be extended into live Google Cloud workflows without redesigning the product.

Why it stands out:

- Most hackathon apps show data.
- CyVix shows what to do next and why.
- Most apps are one-page demos.
- CyVix is structured like a real SaaS with navigation, product sections, and operational views.

## Environment Keys For Production Integration

The current demo works without keys. For live Google Cloud integration, wire the following through environment variables or secret managers:

- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
- `GCP_REGION`
- `VERTEX_LOCATION`
- `BIGQUERY_DATASET`
- `BIGQUERY_TABLE`

- `LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Local Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Demo Notes

- Switch between scenarios to show different city conditions.
- Ask a natural-language question to trigger the decision engine.
- Use the sidebar to jump between product sections.
- Show the agent trace, tool calls, and counterfactual to explain how the system works.
- Point to the Google Cloud mapping to demonstrate that the solution is grounded in real platform primitives.
